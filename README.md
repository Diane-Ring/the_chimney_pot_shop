<p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif"> This project is to develop a retail-focused website for a chimney pot specialist, designed to showcase products, provide practical information, and support customers in choosing the correct chimney pots for their property.<br><br>
From a user perspective, visitors should be able to browse the full range of chimney pots, view detailed product information and specifications, and access guidance on suitability, installation, and maintenance. In future ***'s, users may also be able to make enquiries or purchases directly through the site.<br><br>
In terms of design, a clean and minimal approach is taken to allow product photography and technical detail to take priority. A cohesive colour palette and consistent typography will be used throughout the site to reinforce the brand’s focus on quality, durability, and traditional craftsmanship.<br><br> The layout is designed to be clear and intuitive, enhancing usability and ensuring customers can easily find the information they need with confidence.
<br><br>A responsive site layout enables easy navigation on all devices.
